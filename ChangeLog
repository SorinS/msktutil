- Fix possible samAccountName corruption bug with uniniatialized
  variables (thanks Jaroslaw Polok for the report)
- Adjust --precreate to match ADUC's behavior with long account names
  (thanks Erik de Vries)
- Build fixes for HPUX and NetBSD
- Fix issue with private glibc function on RHEL5 (thanks Daniel Kobras)
- Incorporate hardening patches from Debian (thanks Tony Mancill)
- Delete "debian" directory (this will be maintained downstream)

Release 0.5:

- New co-maintainer, Olaf Flebbe
- Support service accounts in addition to computer accounts
- Add option to set the samba secret password
- Add option ("--realm") to specify a custom realm
- Various build fixes
- Add support for clients behind a NAT firewall

Release 0.4.2:

- New co-maintainer, Mark Pröhl
- Increase computer name character limit from 18 to 19 characters,
  matching AD's own limits.
- Add option ("-N") to disable reverse lookups on DCs
- Add option ("--old-account-password") to use the old computer account
  password to create a new keytab on a host.
- Return the proper error code when krb5_change_password fails.
- Better autodetection for krb5-config location.
- Compatibility with autoconf >= 2.68.
- Build fixes for Red Hat and Ubuntu.
- Update documentation for single-DES and AFS.

Release 0.4.1:

- Ken Dreyer took over maintainance, based upon master at
  http://repo.or.cz/w/msktutil.git
- Build fixes for Red Hat

Release 0.4:

- James Y Knight took over maintainance, based upon msktutil_0.3.16-7
  downloaded from: http://download.systemimager.org/~finley/msktutil/

- Made most functionality work properly with only the machine account
  credentials.

- Adds COMPUTERNAME$ to the keytab, and authenticates with that, so
  that setting userPrincipalName to host/COMPUTERNAME.DOMAIN@REALM
  isn't necessary. (since userPrincipalName isn't settable without
  admin perms)

- Now attempts to authenticate with the default machine account
  password so that AD "reset account" is functional.

- Gets the default LDAP OU to create new machines in from the magic
  GUID from AD, instead of assuming CN=Computers.

- Added --precreate option to allow an administrator to script
  creation of accounts without touching a local keytab.

- Added --auto-update for use from a crontab to auto-rotate password.

- No longer attempts to disable password expiry by default: So note,
  you need to either run --auto-update from cron or else pass the
  (new) argument --dont-expire-password when creating the account.

- Added --remove-service argument.

- Fixed old kvno expiration policy so that it keeps old principals
   around in the keytab for a week, instead of just keeping the
   immediately-prior kvno.

- Disabled use of DES keys by default. You will have to explicitly
  request them with --enctypes if you want them.

- Removed --des-only option, you can use --enctypes if you really want
  to use single DES. (which, of course, you shouldn't, given that it's
  now 2010 and Single DES was known to be utterly broken for over 10
  years by now!)

- Fixed salting to lowercase the account name, as the AD server does.

- Switched languages from C to C++.

- Lots of other cleanup and various bugfixes.
